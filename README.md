# Multinational-Retail-Data-Centralisation
You work for a multinational company that sells various goods across the globe.

Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team.

In an effort to become more data-driven, your organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.
